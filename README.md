# Thermo Components

   A PyQt6-based desktop application for calculating thermodynamic properties of gas and liquid mixtures.  
   The program allows users to select chemical components, specify their composition, and compute properties such as density, phase, bubble point temperature, and lower heating value (LHV) using the `thermo` Python library.

   ## Features
   - User-friendly GUI
   - Supports multiple components 
   - Calculates density, phase, bubble point, and LHV

   ## Requirements
   - Python 3.x
   - PyQt6
   - thermo

   ## Usage
   1. Run `python density.py`
   2. Select components and enter compositions
   3. Set temperature and pressure
   4. Enter composition in mol% or wt%
   5. Click Go to see results
